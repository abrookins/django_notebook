django_notebook
---------------

This is a trivial plugin to IPython notebook that initializes Django inside the notebook.  I find this useful as a replacement for `./manage.py shell.`

To use *django_notebook* open IPython notebook with django_notebook as an extension in your Django project directory.

        % ipython notebook --ext=django_notebook
